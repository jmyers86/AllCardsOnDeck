All Cards On Deck--------


PEDAC Practice:

***20 Numbers***

- turn over 2 at a time
- only swap 2 at a time
- refer to cards based on their positions in list (0,1)
- cannot keep track of value elsewhere


--First Thoughts--

- Flip over first two cards (pos 0,1)
- Move highest card right
- Flip cards back over- face down
- Flip over next cards (pos 1,2)
- Move highest card right
- Flip cards back over- face down
- Flip over next cards (pos 2,3)
- Move highest card right
- Repeat until card cannot be moved right any further
- If at end of list (pos 19), go to (pos 0) and begin again
- If not at end of list, place both cards at end of list (pos 18,19) and flip over-face down-----@
- Go to (pos 0) and begin again

-@ Step not needed

--Clarification--(for humans)

- Flip over cards 1 and 2
- Move highest card to the right
- Flip cards back over- face down
- Flip over cards 2 and 3
- Move highest card to the right
- Flip cards back over- face down
- Flip over cards 3 and 4
- Move highest card to the right
- Flip cards back over- face down
- Flip over cards 4 and 5
- Move highest card to the right
- Flip cards back over- face down
- Repeat until card cannot be moved right any further
- Return to card 1 and repeat process
- If you cannot move a card to the right, the list is in numerical order

++++Final++++
- Flip over cards 1 and 2
- If card on right is a higher number, flip over both cards- face down. If card on left is a higher number, swap so the card on right is the higher number and flip over both cards- face down.
- Flip over cards 2 and 3
- If card on right is a higher number, flip over both cards- face down. If card on left is a higher number, swap so the card on right is the higher number and flip over both cards- face down.
- Flip over cards 3 and 4
- If card on right is a higher number, flip over both cards- face down. If card on left is a higher number, swap so the card on right is the higher number and flip over both cards- face down.
- Repeat process until at the end of the row of cards.
- Return to cards 1 and 2, and repeat process.
- Eventually, you will not be able to move any card to the right. Your list should now be in ascending numerical order.
